# ProgrammingIdea
A collection of solution for the app from GooglePlay Store IdeaBag2 To Explore .NetCore


The main purpose of this project is to do a whole set of exercises to get acquainted with a programming
language. I probably will not develop some exercises as they are not consistent with the purpose of the 
project but are closely related to math or other issues that are not specific to learning to program or that 
they do not often encounter when coding. Anyway, I will create the structure of the folders and the projects 
if someone wants to implement them.

_I Took all things as it is in the app, so i can't say this exercises are really for Beginner or expert or whatever else programmer, for consistency with the app i left them so._
